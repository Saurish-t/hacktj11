                    <p> 
                        Our goal is to help mitigate the risks associated with investing in the stock market. We wish to use machine learning to create a graph that will predict the furture of the buisness based on its previous performance and help you decide whether or not to invest in that company. Additionally, it will help you choose how much you should invest based on the amount you wish to invest, and how confident it is that the company will make profit and not go bankrupt.

                    <p>
                        The problem with many other investing companies or people who claim they will increase your profits is the risk that you loose it all. One bad descision can greatly impact your life and your will to take risks. As a beginner it can be really hard to choose the right company to invest in, and if you are tight on money you may not be able to take a huge loss. That is why we created finance shield. With our machine learning model we will calculate risks of stocks you are interested in investing in, and based on the risk the company going bankrupt and being profitable we will tell you to invest and how much as well.
